## Playlist

playlist is `watir-webdriver` based end-to-end testing framework.

Some Key features are:

* Web-Testing using `watir-webdriver`
* `Database (MySql)` testing using `mysql2`
* `API` tests using `httparty`
* `Native mobile tests` using `appium`.
* `Mobile-On-Web` using `watir-webdriver`
* Works with `jenkins`, `travisCI` etc.

### Folder Structure.

#### playlist
-----------------
`playlist` is the file you will be calling to run your test cases. This needs to be at the root of your directory.

#### Run all the tests from `tests` folder.
--------------------------------------------

    ./playlist

    ./playlist -e qa

you may also provide optional `-e` environment, by default it will look for `default` environment.

you can also pass multiple environments:

      ./playlist -e qa,stg,default

Tests will be run on each environments provided.


#### Run individual tests:
-----------------------------

    ./playlist -e qa -t playlist-files/tests/folder/subFolder/tests1.rb

You may also execute multiple tests together by


 ```
 ./playlist -e qa -t playlist-files/tests/folder/subFolder/tests1.rb playlist-files/tests/folder/subFolder/tests2.rb  playlist-files/tests/folder/subFolder/testsN.rb

  ```

#### Run tests suites:
------------------------
      ./playlist -s playlist-files/tests/folder1/


  You may also execute multiple suites together by


  ```
  ./playlist -s playlist-files/tests/folder1/ playlist-files/tests/folder2/ playlist-files/tests/folderN/

  ```

#### Skip tests:
--------------------
      ./playlist --skip neagativeTests dataCreationTests anyTests

  Note: No need to provide tests path when skipping tests just provide tests names without path or extensions and those tests will be skipped.


### config.yaml
------------------
  config file holds all everything level and global data in yaml format. This file also needs to be placed at root level.

  below fields are required fields in config file:


    global:
      path: files

    default:
      browser: firefox



  you can access all global variables like `$global['data']`

  Your environment variables are available to use in your tests like this. `$config['browser']`

  example config.yaml is provided.


### files/src/pageObjects
-----------------------------------

  unlike other frameworks playlist doesn't control on how you write and use your pageObjects.

   You can organize your pageObjects by creating meaningful Structure and folders/subFolders.

  You must follow following format:


  `# LoginPageObj:`

    class Login
        def self.login(username, password)
            $method = __method__
            ...
              your code for login
            ...  
        end
    end



  you must write ` $method = __method__ ` in each method, this is for better tracking and error reporting.

  you can now call this function in any tests by just invoking class and method like:




    # test1

      Login.login($config['username'], $config['password'])



### files/src/binary
-----------------------------

  You may gather browser executable in this folders and user it in your script. `src` folder path is available via `$srcPath`.




### files/src/bin/data
---------------------------------

  All your data files lives here, Rule is you must follow the same folder Structure as your tests.

   example:




    |__ src
    |     |__ bin
    |          |__ data
    |               |__ web
    |                    |__ UI
    |                         |__ uiTest.yaml
    |
    |
    |__ tests
          |__ web
               |__ UI
                   |__ uiTest1.rb





   When `uiTest1.rb` is begin executed it will pick up data from `uiTest.yaml`  be sure to create correct folders.

   Access all your tests data in your tests : `$test_data['key']`

   Data DIR can be access via `$dataDir`.



### tests
-----------
   Al your tests using pageObjects will be placed here.

   tests DIR can be access via `$testDir`.


### Test Results:
-------------------
   A Success test results looks like below:


     [search_scenarios] Test Suite:
     ==============================
     Running: [emptySearch]
     ENV: qa

    Class: Login
      ‚úì  .initialize_browser
      ‚úì  .login_workflow
    Class: Dashboard
      ‚úì  .links_check
      ‚úì  .icons_check
      ‚úì  .styles


      üëç    [  00 mins. & 06 seconds  ]



   A Failed test would be:


    [search_scenarios] Test Suite:
    ==============================
    Running: [emptySearch]
    ENV: qa1

    Class: Login
     ‚úì  .initialize_browser

     ‚úì  .links_check
     ‚úì  .icons_check

### Web-Test Example:
--------------------
`tests` directory includes `example-web` folder with `qa.moodle.net` web tests.

Run it:

  ` ./playlist -e qa -s files/tests/example-web/`

### API-Test Example:
--------------------
`tests` directory includes `example-api` folder with `api methods`.

Run it:

  ` ./playlist -e qa -s files/tests/example-api/`
